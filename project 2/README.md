# TSBB17 Project 2: Visual Object Tracking
Lukas Borggren, Viktor Gustafsson and Gustav Wahlquist.

# Introduction
This project aims to evaluate the MOSSE tracker and how it performs with different maps of features on
the OTB-mini dataset.

# Final Performance

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a subset of the OTB benchmark called OTB-mini. It consists of 30
image sequences together with a ground truth bounding box for each frame. The sequences include a
varying number of frames, but the size of the frames are consistent across the whole dataset.
During evaluation, the learning rate and regularization term are both fixed to 0.01 for the MOSSE tracker.
For the two-dimensional Gaussian function, ùúá = 0 and ùúé = 2 is used. These parameters were varied and
tested for a few iterations on the MOSSE tracker with different feature configurations before settling on
the final values.


## Installation
